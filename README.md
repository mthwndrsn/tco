# Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator

This is a simple web-based tool to calculate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for a software application. The calculator takes into account various cost components, such as initial costs, ongoing costs, indirect costs, direct costs, and depreciation, over a specified number of years.

## Features

- **Initial Costs:** Includes expenses like software license fees, hardware costs, and implementation fees.
- **Ongoing Costs:** Considers recurring costs such as maintenance, support, updates, and training.
- **Indirect Costs:** Accounts for productivity loss, downtime, and other indirect expenses.
- **Direct Costs:** Involves operational costs, salaries of IT staff, and other direct expenditures.
- **Depreciation:** Calculates the depreciation of assets over time.
- **Customizable Time Period:** Calculate TCO over a specified number of years.

## How to Use

1. **Input Costs:** Enter the values for initial costs, ongoing costs, indirect costs, direct costs, and depreciation in the respective fields.
2. **Set Time Period:** Enter the number of years for which you want to calculate the TCO.
3. **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate TCO" button to see the total cost of ownership.

The result will be displayed as a total dollar amount, representing the overall cost of ownership over the specified period.
